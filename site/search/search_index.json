Onboard new users and easily verify their digital identities by making sure the IDs they provide are valid and authentic. Extract data from ID documents completely automatically and within seconds. Confirm that users really are who they say they are by having them take a quick selfie and match it to their respective documents. Jumio uses cutting-edge biometric technology such as 3D face mapping to make sure there is an actual, real-life person in front of the screen. Using the Jumio SDK will allow you to create the best possible solution for your individual needs, providing you with a range of different services to choose from. Previous SDK Versions If you need information on older SDK versions, please refer to: - 3.9.2 - 3.9.1 - 3.9.0 Code Documentation Full API documentation for the Jumio Android SDK can be found here . Quickstart This section provides a quick overview on how to get started with the Android sample application that can be found here on Github. You will need a commercial Jumio License to successfully run any of our examples; for details, contact sales@jumio.com. You will also need an up-to-date Android Studio version to open and try out the sample project. Start by downloading the Android sample application from the Jumio Github repo. You can either clone the repository (using SSH or HTTPS) to your local device or simply download everything as a ZIP. Once you\u2019ve got the sample application downloaded and unzipped, open Android Studio. Choose Import project and navigate to where you\u2019ve saved your sample application. Select the JumioMobileSample folder and open it. Android Studio will now start to import the project. This might take a bit of time. Make sure to wait until the Gradle Build has finished and the application is properly installed! The Android sample application contains the package com.jumio.sample.kotlin , which consists of: MainActivity customui CustomUIActivity CustomCountryAdapter CustomDocumentAdapter CustomVariantAdapter Right at the top of the CustomUiActivity you\u2019ll find a companion object with the following empty parameters: const val EXTRA_TOKEN=\"sdk_token\" const val EXTRA_DATACENTER=\"datacenter\" If you haven't done so already, please refer to the Authentication and Encryption section for more details on how to obtain your SDK token. Add your individual SDK token instead of the placeholder. The default setting for the data center is JumioDataCenter.US . \u26a0\ufe0f Note: We strongly recommend not storing any credentials inside your app! We suggest loading them during runtime from your server-side implementation. Once you start up the sample application, you'll be given the option of trying out the Jumio SDK. Click the hamburger menu in the top left corner to choose a service. Your application will also need camera permissions, which will be prompted for automatically once you try to start any of the services. If you deny camera permissions, you won't be able to use any of the services. Basics General Requirements \u26a0\ufe0f Android Deprecation Notice Please be aware that the upcoming SDK 4.7.0 will be the last SDK version supporting Android 5.0 (API level 21). All subsequent SDK versions will require at least Android 6.0 \"Marshmallow\" (API level 23). The minimum requirements for the SDK are: - Android 5.0 \"Lollipop\" (API level 21) or higher - Internet connection - Jumio KYX The following architectures are supported in the SDK: - ARMv7 processor with Neon - ARM64-v8a \u2139\ufe0f Note: Currently, x86 and x86_64 are not supported. You get an UnsatisfiedLinkError if app and CPU architecture do not match or the CPU architecture is not supported. You will need a commercial Jumio License to run any of our examples. For details, contact sales@jumio.com. Authentication and Encryption \u2139\ufe0f As of version 4.0.0 and onward, the SDK can only be used in combination with Jumio KYX. API v2 as well as using API token and secret to authenticate against the SDK will no longer be compatible. Before starting a session in our SDK, an SDK token has to be obtained. Please refer to out API Guide for further details. To authenticate against the API calls, an OAuth2 access token needs to be retrieved from the Customer Portal. Within the response of the Account Creation or Account Update API, a SDK token is returned, which needs to be applied to initiate the mobile SDK. Basic Authentication (Deprecated) Previously, Basic Auth credentials were constructed using your API token as the User ID and your API secret as the password. You still can manage API token and secret in the Customer Portal under: * Settings > API credentials > API Users Authentication with OAuth2 Your OAuth2 credentials are constructed using your API token as the Client ID and your API secret as the Client secret. You can view and manage your API token and secret in the Customer Portal under: * Settings > API credentials > OAuth2 Clients Client ID and Client secret are used to generate an OAuth2 access token. OAuth2 has to be activated for your account. Contact your Jumio Account Manager for activation. Access Token URL (OAuth2) US: https://auth.amer-1.jumio.ai/oauth2/token EU: https://auth.emea-1.jumio.ai/oauth2/token SG: https://auth.apac-1.jumio.ai/oauth2/token The TLS Protocol is required to securely transmit your data, and we strongly recommend using the latest version. For information on cipher suites supported by Jumio during the TLS handshake see supported cipher suites . \u2139\ufe0f Note: Calls with missing, incorrect or suspicious headers or parameter values will result in HTTP status code 400 Bad Request Error or 403 Forbidden . Request Access Token (OAuth2) curl --request POST --location 'https://auth.amer-1.jumio.ai/oauth2/token' \\ --header 'Accept: application/json' \\ --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\ --data-raw 'grant_type=client_credentials' \\ --basic --user CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET Response Access Token (OAuth2) { \"access_token\": \"YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN\", \"expires_in\": 3600, \"token_type\": \"Bearer\" } Access Token Timeout (OAuth2) Your OAuth2 access token is valid for 60 minutes. After the token lifetime is expired, it is necessary to generate a new access token. Workflow Transaction Token Timeout The token lifetime is set to 30 minutes per default. It can be configured via the Jumio Customer Portal and can be overwritten using the API call ( tokenLifetime ). Within this token lifetime the token can be used to initialize the SDK. As soon as the workflow (transaction) starts, a 15 minutes session timeout is triggered. For each action performed (capture image, upload image) the session timeout will reset, and the 15 minutes will start again. After creating/updating a new account you will receive a sdk.token (JWT) for initializing the SDK. Use this SDK token with your Android code: sdk = JumioSDK(context: Context).apply { token = \"YOUR_SDK_TOKEN\" dataCenter = \"YOUR_DATACENTER\" } Permissions The following permission is optional: <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.VIBRATE\"/> \u2139\ufe0f Note: On devices running Android Marshmallow (6.0) and above, you need to acquire android.permissions.CAMERA dynamically before initializing the SDK. Use JumioSDK.hasAllRequiredPermissions(context: Context) to make sure the Jumio SDK has all required permissions. In case this method returns false , use the method JumioSDK.getMissingPermissions(context: Context) , which will return an array list containing String values of all missing permissions. Request any missing permissions using the ActivityCompat.requestPermissions() method. Integration Use the SDK in your application by including the Maven repositories with the following build.gradle configuration in Android Studio: repositories { google() mavenCentral() exclusiveContent { forRepository { maven { url 'https://repo.mobile.jumio.ai' } } filter { includeGroup \"com.jumio.android\" includeGroup \"com.iproov.sdk\" } } } Check the Android Studio sample projects to learn the most common use. Proguard Mandatory The following Proguard Keep rules have to be added to the Jumio Mobile SDK: -keep class com.jumio.** { *; } -keep class jumio.** { *; } Optional The following Proguard Keep rules have to be added to the Jumio Mobile SDK if the corresponding dependencies have been added: #Microblink -keep class com.microblink.** { *; } -keep class com.microblink.**$* { *; } -dontwarn com.microblink.** #IProov -keep public class com.iproov.sdk.IProov {public *; } -keep class com.iproov.** { *; } -keep class com.iproov.**$* { *; } -keep class com.google.protobuf.** { *; } -keep class com.google.protobuf.**$* { *; } -dontwarn com.google.protobuf.** -dontwarn com.tinder.** -dontwarn okhttp3.** -dontwarn okio.** #JMRTD -keep class org.jmrtd.** { *; } -keep class net.sf.scuba.** {*;} -keep class org.bouncycastle.** {*;} -keep class org.ejbca.** {*;} -dontwarn java.nio.** -dontwarn org.codehaus.** -dontwarn org.ejbca.** -dontwarn org.bouncycastle.** -dontwarn module-info Most of the Proguard settings are applied automatically, as they are defined as consumer Proguard rules within the SDK. The current rules can also be found in the Sample app . Language Localization Our SDK supports default Android localization features for different languages. All label texts and button titles in the SDK can be changed and localized by adding the required Strings you want to change in a strings.xml file in a values directory for the language and culture preference that you want to support. You can check out strings that are modifiable within our Sample application . Jumio SDK products support the following languages: Afrikaans, Arabic, Bulgarian, Chinese(Simplified), Chinese(Traditional), Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Khmer, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Maltese, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Thai, Turkish, Vietnamese, Zulu Our SDK supports accessibility features. Visually impaired users can now enable TalkBack or increase the text size on their device. The accessibility strings that are used by TalkBack contain accessibility in their key and can be also modified in strings.xml . Document Verification As of Android SDK 4.3.0, Document Verification functionality is available. This functionality allows users to submit a number of different document types (e.g. a utility bill or bank statement) in digital form and verify the validity and authenticity of this document. Documents can be submitted using one of two ways: Taking a photo of the document or uploading a PDF file. For more details, please refer to our integration guide . Supported Documents: BC (Birth certificate) BS (Bank statement) CAAP (Cash advance application) CB (Council bill) CC (Credit card) CCS (Credit card statement) CRC (Corporate resolution certificate) CUSTOM HCC (Health care card) IC (Insurance card) LAG (Lease agreement) LOAP (Loan application) MEDC (Medicare card) MOAP (Mortgage application) PB (Phone bill) SEL (School enrollment letter) SENC (Seniors card) SS (Superannuation statement) SSC (Social security card) STUC (Student card) TAC (Trade association card) TR (Tax return) UB (Utility bill) VC (Voided check) VT (Vehicle title) WWCC (Working with children check) \u2139\ufe0f Note: To enable the use of this feature, please contact Jumio support . Digital Identity As of Jumio Android SDK 4.5.0, users may use their Digital Identity to verify their identity. For now 'ID by Mastercard' is the only Digital Identity provider currently supported by our SDK. If you want to enable Digital Identity verification for your account please contact us . In case you are already set up to use Digital Identity verification within your app, check out the integration steps explained here . #Analytics With Datadog Analytic feedback and diagnostics enable us to continually improve our SDK and its performance, as well as investigate potential issues. With the Jumio SDK, we use Datadog as an optional tool to collect diagnostic information. Data collected includes specific SDK information like version numbers, started and finished SDK instances and scan workflows, thrown exceptions and error information, as well as other mobile events. Please note that gathering analytics data requires user consent due to legal regulations such as GDPR. The consent is granted when our MLA is accepted. To benefit from Datadog, add the following dependency to your build.gradle file: implementation \"com.jumio.android:datadog:${SDK_VERSION}\" To grant or revoke user consent, please use JumioSDK.giveDataDogConsent(boolean) method. \u26a0\ufe0f Note: The use of the Datadog module is only possible if it is not already included in your application. Security All SDK related traffic is sent over HTTPS using TLS and public key pinning. Additionally, the information itself within the transmission is also encrypted utilizing Application Layer Encryption (ALE). ALE is a Jumio custom-designed security protocol that utilizes RSA-OAEP and AES-256 to ensure that the data cannot be read or manipulated even if the traffic was captured. Release Notes See our Change Log for more information about our current SDK version and further details.

Check it out at here.","title":"Contact"},{"location":"integration_faq/","text":"Frequently Asked Questions User Consent User consent is now acquired for all users to ensure the accordance with biometric data protection laws. Depending on the legal requirements, consent can be acquired in one of two ways: Active or passive . For active consent instances, the user needs to accept the consent items explicitly, e.g. by enabling a UI switch or checking a checkbox for each consent item. For passive consent instances, it is enough to present the consent text and URL to the user. The user implicitly accepts the passive consent items by continuing with the journey. Improve User Experience and Reduce Drop-off Rate When evaluating user flows, one of the most commonly used metrics is the rate of drop-offs. At Jumio, we see considerable variance in drop-off rates across industries and customer implementations. For some implementations and industries, we see a higher rate of drop-offs on the first screens when compared with the average. Scanning an ID with sensitive personal data printed on it naturally creates a high barrier for participation on the part of the end user. Therefore, conversion rates can be significantly influenced when the application establishes a sense of trust and ensures that users feel secure sharing their information. One pattern that is recognizable throughout all of our customers\u2019 SDK implementations: the more seamless the SDK integration, and the better job is done of setting user expectations prior to the SDK journey, the lower the drop-off rate becomes. Our SDK provides a variety of customization options to help customers achieve a seamless integration. For customers using the standard SDK workflow, our Surface tool provides an easy-to-use WYSIWYG interface to see simple customization options that can be incorporated with minimal effort and generate the code necessary to implement them. For customers who want to have more granular control over look and feel, our SDK offers the CustomUI option, which allows you to customize the entire user interface. Example of a Non-Ideal SDK integration: - Default SDK UI is used and is presented on one of the first screens during onboarding. The user is unprepared for the next steps and might not understand the intention behind the request to show their ID. Suggested Improvements with Additional Customization: - Host application has an explanatory help screen that explains what will happen next and why this information is needed. - SDK is either customized to have a more embedded appearance or CustomUI is used to create a completely seamless integration in the UX of our customers. - Also after the Jumio workflow that shows the displayed results and/or a message that the ID is currently verified, which might take some minutes. Managing Errors Not every error that is returned from the SDK should be treated the same. The error codes listed for ID Verification should be handled specifically. The following table highlights the most common error codes which are returned from the SDK and explains how to handle them appropriately in your application. Code Cause Recommended Handling A[xx][yyyy] Caused by temporary network issues like a slow connection. Advise to check the signal and retry the SDK journey. E[xx][yyyy] Flight mode is activated or no connection available. The user should be asked to disable flight mode or to verify if the phone has proper signal. Advise to connect to WIFI and retry the SDK journey afterwards. G[xx][0000] The user pressed back or X to exit the SDK while no error view was presented. Reasons for this could be manifold. Often it might be due to the fact that the user didn't have his identity document at hand. Give the user the option to retry. J[xx][yyyy] The SDK journey was not completed within the session's max. lifetime. (The default is 15 minutes.) The user should be informed about the timeout and be directed to start a new Jumio SDK session. Ad Blockers or Firewall End users might face the situation where they are connected to a network that can't reach our Jumio endpoints. Possible reasons for this might be ad blockers on the device, network wide ad blockers or network specific firewall settings. In these cases the SDK will return a specific error code: A10900 If this error is received, we suggest to add a screen where the user is advised to switch network and/or turn off possible ad blockers. Reducing the Size of Your App The Netverify SDK contains a wide range of different scanning methods. The SDK is able to capture identity documents and extract information on the device using enhanced machine learning and computer vision technologies. The current download size of the sample application containing all products is around 12.5 MB as mentioned in the ID Verification guide . If you want to reduce the size of the SDK within your application, there are several ways to achieve this: Strip Unused Modules Depending on your specific needs, you may want to strip out unused functionality. As most of our modules can be linked optionally, you can reduce file size by adapting your Jumio dependencies in your build.gradle. The following table shows a range of different product configurations with the size and modules that are linked for it. These measurements reflect the extra size that Jumio components add to your app download size and are based on our sample application . Product Configuration Size Modules Base 2.68 MB core Base + iProov 3.51 MB core, iproov Base + MRZ 4.19 MB core, mrz Base + MRZ, Linefinder 4.57 MB core, mrz, linefinder Base + MRZ, Linefinder, Barcode 5.62 MB core, mrz, linefinder, barcode Base + MRZ, Linefinder, Barcode-Vision 4.89 MB core, mrz, linefinder, barcode-vision Base + MRZ, Linefinder, Barcode, iProov 6.45 MB core, mrz, linefinder, barcode, iproov Base + MRZ, Linefinder, Barcode, Liveness 8.93 MB core, mrz, linefinder, barcode, liveness Base + MRZ, Linefinder, Barcode, NFC 7.26 MB core, mrz, linefinder, barcode, nfc All (Custom UI only) 13.07 MB core, mrz, linefinder, barcode, barcode-vision, iproov, nfc, docfinder, devicerisk, liveness Base + MRZ, Linefinder, Default UI 4.92 MB core, mrz, linefinder, default-ui Base + MRZ, Linefinder, Default UI, DataDog 5.09 MB core, mrz, linefinder, default-ui, datadog All (with Default UI) 13.58 MB core, mrz, linefinder, barcode, barcode-vision, iproov, nfc, docfinder, devicerisk, default-ui, datadog, liveness Note: The size values in the table above depict the decompressed install size required on a device and are comparable to the estimated Play Store files size. The size value might vary by a few percent, depending on the actual device used. All sizes are calculated based on a build of our sample application using arm64 architecture, english translations and xxhdpi screen resolution. App Bundles Android offers a way to reduce the size of a customer's built application using App bundles Google Play\u2019s new app serving model uses the App bundle to generate and serve optimized APKs for each user\u2019s device configuration, so they download only the code and resources they need to run your app. Architectures, ABI Filters & Splitting The SDK supports armeabi-v7a and arm64-v8a architecture. You can filter which architecture to use by specifying the abiFilters. That way, you could manually filter for armeabi-v7a as arm64-v8a . Be aware: As of August 2019, Google Play Console will require that new apps and app updates with native libraries provide 64-bit versions in addition to their 32-bit versions, as mentioned in the Android developers blog. . Note: The abiFilters command in the ndk closure affects the Google Play Store filtering. defaultConfig { ndk { abiFilters armeabi-v7a\",\"arm64-v8a\",\"x86\",\"x86_64\" } } It's also possible to manually provide a split apk on Google Play. The apk can be split based on the architecture if multiple apks should be uploaded to the Google Play Store. Google Play Store manages to deliver the appropriate apk for the device. splits { abi { enable true reset() include armeabi-v7a\",\"arm64-v8a\",\"x86\",\"x86_64\" universalApk false } } Jumio Authentication Workflow Integration Jumio Authentication can be used for any use case in which you want your end-users to confirm their identities. As a result of the Authentication journey you get a success or failed result back from the SDK or from our server (callback or retrieval). In case of a successful result you can grant the user access to your service or let him proceed with the user flow. In case of a failed result , a proper retry handling within your workflow is necessary. A failure could occur because of the following reasons: * The user presenting their face is a different one than the user who owns the account * An imposter is trying to spoof the liveness check * User does not want to show their face at all, but is still trying to complete the onboarding * User does not look straight into the camera * User does not finish the first or second step of face scan * User has bad lighting conditions (too dark, too bright, reflections on face, not enough contrast, \u2026) * User is covering (parts) of their face with a scarf, hat or something similar * A different person is scanning their face in the second step than in the first one * User is not able to align his face with the oval presented during scanning In case an Authentication fail is returned, we recommend to allow the user between 3-5 Authentication attempts to prove their identity, before you lock the user from performing the action. This approach makes the most sense, as you don't want to lock out possible valid users who might not have completed the face capture task successfully for a legitimate reason. Don't worry about offering a potential fraudster more attempts to gain access to your system - our bullet proof liveness check does not allow them to get a successful result. Fallback and Manual Capturing The method isFallbackAvailable() determines if a fallback for the current scan mode is available and returns a boolean. If the method returns true, the available fallback scan mode will have to be started with the method startFallback() . The method showShutterButton() determines if a shutter button needs to be shown because the image has to be taken manually and returns a boolean. If the method returns true, you will have to display your own shutter button and call the method takePicture() once it is clicked. Note: Please note that the method showShutterButton() does neither create nor display the actual shutter button! \"Manual capturing\" simply refers to the user being able to manually take a picture. \"Fallback\" refers to an alternative scan mode the SDK can resort to if possible, in case there is an issue during the original scanning process. The fallback scan mode might be manual capturing in some cases, but not all. Custom Theme Custom Theme Is Not Working Any customized theme needs to be defined in a styles.xml file and has to inherit from the parent theme Theme.Jumio . <style name=\"AppTheme.JumioCustom\" parent=\"Theme.Jumio\"> <item name=\"colorPrimary\">@color/colorPrimary</item> ... </style> The actual name of the customized theme is arbitrary and can be chosen at will. Any customized theme needs to be added to the AndroidManifest.xml file by replacing the initial Theme.Jumio . <activity android:name=\"com.jumio.defaultui.JumioActivity\" android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme.JumioCustom\" ... <activity/> Scan Overlay Is Not Displayed Make sure all necessary style attributes have been added to your custom theme specified in the style.xml file. In case of issues with scan overlay, all relevant attributes start with jumio_scanOverlay and face_scanOverlay . An overview of all style attributes can be found here Language Localization Jumio Android Localization supports the default Android localization features for a number of different languages and cultures. Any language changes within the SDK or separate language support during runtime (meaning the SDK language differs from the overall device languages) are not possible. All label texts and button titles in the SDK can be changed and localized by adding the required Strings you want to change in a strings.xml file in a values directory for the language and culture preference that you want to support. All modifiable strings can be modified can be found within our Sample application . Currently, the following languages are automatically supported for your convenience: Supported languages Runtime language changes within the SDK or separate language support (meaning the SDK language differs from the overall device languages) is not possible. All of the used string values can be found in the sample project resource folder . If you want to manage certain strings individually , please access them in the values-xx folder that corresponds to the language. Note: The last two letters of the values folder (marked \"xx\" above) refer to the ISO alpha-2 country code , which has to be used for the localization to work automatically. Please refer to the country list if you have trouble determining which string file contains to which language. Accessibility Our SDK supports accessibility features. Visually impaired users can now enable TalkBack or increase the text size on their device. The accessibility-strings that are used by TalkBack contain accessibility in their key and can be also modified in the strings.xml . String Updates For an overview of all updates and changes of SDK string keys please refer to the revision history on Github. Java 8 Compatibility Jumio SDK uses Java 8 language. It is necessary to enable Java 8 source and target compatibility for in the build.gradle file using compileOptions : android { ... compileOptions { sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8 targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8 } } Overview of Scanning Methods Autocapture Combines all previously existing scanning methods into one automatic, seamless experience. Linefinder Scanning using edge detection. MRZ Data extraction from passports, some identity cards and some visas. Barcode PDF417 barcode data extraction, for example from US and Canadian driver licenses. Manual Capture Manual scanning (taking a picture) using the shutterbutton, fallback option in case user is having trouble. NFC Data extraction from eMRTD documents, for example passports.

As a result of the Authentication journey you get a success or failed result back from the SDK or from our server (callback or retrieval). In case of a successful result you can grant the user access to your service or let him proceed with the user flow. In case of a failed result , a proper retry handling within your workflow is necessary. A failure could occur because of the following reasons: * The user presenting their face is a different one than the user who owns the account * An imposter is trying to spoof the liveness check * User does not want to show their face at all, but is still trying to complete the onboarding * User does not look straight into the camera * User does not finish the first or second step of face scan * User has bad lighting conditions (too dark, too bright, reflections on face, not enough contrast, \u2026) * User is covering (parts) of their face with a scarf, hat or something similar * A different person is scanning their face in the second step than in the first one * User is not able to align his face with the oval presented during scanning In case an Authentication fail is returned, we recommend to allow the user between 3-5 Authentication attempts to prove their identity, before you lock the user from performing the action. This approach makes the most sense, as you don't want to lock out possible valid users who might not have completed the face capture task successfully for a legitimate reason.

Release Notes Please refer to our Change Log for more information. Current SDK version: 4.6.0 For technical changes that should be considered when updating the SDK, please read our Transition Guide . Code Documentation Full API documentation for the Jumio Android SDK can be found here . Setup The basic setup is required before continuing with the following setup for the Jumio SDK. If you are updating your SDK to a newer version, please also refer to: Changelog Transition Guide Dependencies The SDK Setup Tool is a web tool that helps determine available product combinations and corresponding dependencies for the Jumio SDK, as well as an export feature to easily import the applied changes straight into your codebase. Below you can find a list of dependencies that can be added to your application to enable different functionality of the Jumio SDK. Some modules are mandatory, others are optional. If an optional module is not linked , some functionalities may not be available, but the library size will be reduced. The Sample app apk size is currently around 17 MB . // [Mandatory] Jumio Core library dependencies { implementation \"com.jumio.android:core:4.6.0\" ... } // [Optional] Extraction methods dependencies { implementation \"com.jumio.android:mrz:4.6.0\" // MRZ scanning implementation \"com.jumio.android:nfc:4.6.0\" // NFC scanning implementation \"com.jumio.android:linefinder:4.6.0\" // Linefinder scanning implementation \"com.jumio.android:docfinder:4.6.0\" // Autocapture library implementation \"com.jumio.android:barcode:4.6.0\" // Barcode scanning implementation \"com.jumio.android:iproov:4.6.0\" // Face Liveness library implementation \"com.jumio.android:liveness:4.6.0\" // Face Liveness library implementation \"com.jumio.android:digital-identity:4.6.0\" // Digital Identity verification library ... } // [Optional] Extraction methods alternatives dependencies { implementation \"com.jumio.android:barcode-mlkit:4.6.0\" // Barcode scanning alternative ... } // [Optional] Jumio Default UI dependencies { implementation \"com.jumio.android:defaultui:4.6.0\" ... } // [Optional] Additional functionality dependencies { implementation \"com.jumio.android:datadog:4.6.0\" // Analytics library implementation \"com.jumio.android:devicerisk:4.6.0\" // Device fingerprinting library ... } SDK Version Check Use JumioSDK.sdkVersion to check which SDK version is being used. Root Detection For security reasons, applications implementing the SDK should not run on rooted devices. Use either the below method or a self-devised check to prevent usage of SDK scanning functionality on rooted devices. JumioSDK.isRooted(context: Context) \u26a0\ufe0f Note: Please be aware that the JumioSDK root check uses various mechanisms for detection, but doesn't guarantee to detect 100% of all rooted devices. Device Supported Check Use the method below to check if the current device platform is supported by the SDK. JumioSDK.isSupportedPlatform(context: Context) Autocapture The module com.jumio.android:docfinder offers one generic scanning method across all ID documents, providing a more seamless capture experience for the end user. The SDK will automatically detect which type of ID document is presented by the user and guide them through the capturing process with live feedback. The models can be bundled with the app directly to save time on the download during the SDK runtime. Therefore download the following files from here and here and add it to the app assets folder. Certified Face Liveness Jumio uses Certified Liveness technology to determine liveness. Link com.jumio.android:liveness and com.jumio.android:iproov modules in order to use Jumio Liveness. If necessary, the iProov SDK version can be overwritten with a more recent one: implementation \"com.jumio.android:iproov:4.6.0\" implementation(\"com.iproov.sdk:iproov:8.3.1\") { exclude group: 'org.json', module: 'json' } Barcode Scanning Alternative As an alternative to the com.jumio.android:barcode dependency, you can substitute com.jumio.android:barcode-mlkit . This dependency includes com.google.android.gms:play-services-mlkit-barcode-scanning library - if your application includes other Google ML-kit libraries , it might be necessary to override meta-data specified in the application tag of the play-services-mlkit-barcode-scanning manifest by merging multiple manifests : <meta-data android:name=\"com.google.android.gms.vision.DEPENDENCIES\" android:value=\"barcode\" tools:replace=\"android:value\" /> Privacy Notice If the module com.jumio.android:devicerisk is linked we collect data depending on the permissions given for fraud detection on Location Battery Usage Device Identifier Device Storage MAC Address SIM information (MNC, MCC, IMEI, Phone Number, Phone Type (GSM/CDMA), SIM Number, etc.) Google Services ID If you submit your app to the Google Play Store a Prominent Disclosure explaining the collected User Data is required. The collected user data also needs to be declared in your Data Safety Form and the Privacy Policy related to your application. Other stores might require something similar - please check before submitting your app to the store. Please see the Jumio Privacy Policy for Online Services for further information. Digital Identity (DID) In case Digital Identity verification has been enabled for your account you can add the com.jumio.android:digital-identity dependency to your application. This will enable you to make use of DID verification within the SDK. Over the course of DID verification the SDK will launch an according third party application representing your Digital Identity. Communication between both applications (your integrating application and the Digital Identity application) is done via a so-called \"deep link\". For more information on deep link handling on Android please check out their official guide . Deep link setup To enable your app specific deep link, our support team has to setup an according scheme of your choice for you. This scheme will be used by the SDK to identify your application while returning from the DID provider's application. For the scheme basically any string can be used, however it is recommended that it is unique to your application in some way. A suggestion would be your company name. Following snippet shows how the deep link needs to be setup in your application's AndroidManifest.xml file: <activity android:name=\"com.jumio.app.HostingActivity\" android:exported=\"true\" android:launchMode=\"singleTask\" android:theme=\"@style/Theme.Jumio\"> <intent-filter> <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" /> <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" /> <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" /> <data android:scheme=\"<your-app-scheme>\" /> </intent-filter> </activity> Please note that the properties android:exported=\"true\" and android:launchMode=\"singleTask\" need to be specified as well. The first parameter basically tells the Android system that your Activity can be found by the system and other applications. By specifying launchMode=\"singleTask\" any already running task for this Activity will be resumed (instead of creating a new instance). Both are requirements so that the SDK can handle the according deep link correctly. In case you are using Jumio's Default UI in your app (see section Default UI ) you also need to specify tools:replace=\"android:exported\" to JumioActivity 's <activity> tag like so: <activity android:name=\"com.jumio.defaultui.JumioActivity\" android:exported=\"true\" android:launchMode=\"singleTask\" tools:replace=\"android:exported\"> <intent-filter> ... </intent-filter> </activity> As deep link handling happens on Activity level, the according data needs to be forwarded to the SDK via Activity.onNewIntent() . The following code snippet shows how this can be achieved. If you're using Jumio's Default UI you can ignore this step . override fun onNewIntent(intent: Intent) { super.onNewIntent(intent) intent.data?.let { deepLink -> val activeScanPart = scanPart ?: return JumioDeepLinkHandler.consumeForScanPart(deepLink, activeScanPart) } } Initialization Requesting a Token (via OAuth2) Your OAuth2 credentials are constructed using your API token as the Client ID and your API secret as the Client secret. You can view and manage your Client ID and secret in the Customer Portal under: Settings > API credentials > OAuth2 Clients Client ID and Client secret are used to generate an OAuth2 access token. Send a workflow request using the acquired OAuth2 access token to receive the SDK token necessary to initialize the Jumio SDK. OAuth2 has to be activated for your account. Contact your Jumio Account Manager for activation. For more details, please refer to Authentication and Encryption . Initializing the Jumio SDK Use your aquired SDK token and your according datacenter to initialize the JumioSDK : const val YOUR_SDK_TOKEN = \"\" const val YOUR_DATACENTER = \"\" sdk = JumioSDK(context: Context).apply { token = \"YOUR_SDK_TOKEN\" datacenter = \"YOUR_DATACENTER\" } Data center is set to \"US\" by default. If your customer account is in the EU data center, use \"EU\" instead. Alternatively, use \"SG\" for Singapore. \u26a0\ufe0f Note: We strongly recommend storing all credentials outside of your app! We suggest loading them during runtime from your server-side implementation. Configuration Every Jumio SDK instance is initialized using a specific sdk.token . This token contains information about the workflow, credentials, transaction identifiers and other parameters. Configuration of this token allows you to provide your own internal tracking information for the user and their transaction, specify what user information is captured and by which method, as well as preset options to enhance the user journey. Values configured within the sdk.token during your API request will override any corresponding settings configured in the Customer Portal. Worfklow Selection Use ID verification callback to receive a verification status and verified data positions (see Callback section ). Make sure that your customer account is enabled to use this feature. A callback URL can be specified for individual transactions (for URL constraints see chapter Callback URL ). This setting overrides any callback URL you have set in the Jumio Customer Portal. Your callback URL must not contain sensitive data like PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or account login. Set your callback URL using the callbackUrl parameter. Use the correct workflow definition key in order to request a specific workflow. Set your key using the workflowDefinition.key parameter. { \"customerInternalReference\": \"CUSTOMER_REFERENCE\", \"workflowDefinition\": { \"key\": \"X\" }, \"callbackUrl\": \"YOUR_CALLBACK_URL\" } For more details, please refer to our Workflow Description Guide . \u2139\ufe0f Note: Identity Verification requires portrait orientation in your app. Transaction Identifiers There are several options in order to uniquely identify specific transactions. customerInternalReference allows you to specify your own unique identifier for a certain scan (max. 100 characters). Use reportingCriteria , to identify the scan in your reports (max. 100 characters). You can also set a unique identifier for each user using userReference (max. 100 characters). For more details, please refer to our API Guide . { \"customerInternalReference\": \"CUSTOMER_REFERENCE\", \"workflowDefinition\": { \"key\": \"X\" }, \"reportingCriteria\": \"YOUR_REPORTING_CRITERIA\", \"userReference\": \"YOUR_USER_REFERENCE\" } \u26a0\ufe0f Note: Transaction identifiers must not contain sensitive data like PII (Personally Identifiable Information) or account login. Preselection You can specify issuing country using ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 country codes, as well as ID types to skip selection during the scanning process. In the example down below, Austria (\"AUT\") and the USA (\"USA\") have been preselected. PASSPORT and DRIVER_LICENSE have been chosen as preselected document types. If all parameters are preselected and valid and there is only one given combination (one country and one document type), the document selection screen in the SDK can be skipped entirely. For more details, please refer to our API Guide . \u26a0\ufe0f Note: \"Digital Identity\" document type can not be preselected! { \"customerInternalReference\": \"CUSTOMER_REFERENCE\", \"workflowDefinition\": { \"key\": X, \"credentials\": [ { \"category\": \"ID\", \"type\": { \"values\": [ \"DRIVING_LICENSE\", \"PASSPORT\" ] }, \"country\": { \"values\": [ \"AUT\", \"USA\" ] } } ] } } Miscellaneous Use cameraFacing attribute of JumioScanView to configure the default camera and set it to FRONT or BACK . scanView.cameraFacing = JumioCameraFacing.FRONT SDK Workflow Retrieving Information The SDK returns a JumioResult object which contains the result of the finished workflow. Extracted ID data will not be returned by default - please contact Jumio Customer Service at support@jumio.com in case this is needed.

Default UI In case you're using Jumio's Default UI module (see Dependencies ) you may declare the JumioActivity in your AndroidManifest.xml . With this you can use Jumio's default theme or specify a custom theme (see Customization for details). Also you can set the orientation to be sensor based or locked by using the attribute android:screenOrientation . Please note though that some screens in Jumio SDK launch in portrait mode only. <activity android:theme=\"@style/Theme.Jumio\" android:hardwareAccelerated=\"true\" android:name=\"com.jumio.defaultui.JumioActivity\" android:configChanges=\"orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|keyboardHidden\" /> Custom UI ID Verification can be also implemented as a custom scan view. This means that only the scan view (including the scan overlays) are provided by the SDK. The handling of the lifecycle, document selection, readability confirmation, intermediate callbacks, and all other steps necessary to complete a scan have to be handled by the client application that implements the SDK. The following sequence diagram outlines components, callbacks and methods for a basic ID Verification workflow: \u26a0\ufe0f Note: The new 3D face liveness capturing technology is not optimized for tablets. When using Identity Verification, the face scanner will fallback to a simple face capturing functionality instead. Portrait orientation support is required in your app. CustomUI enables you to use a custom scan view with a plain scanning user interface. Initialize the Jumio SDK and set token and datacenter . sdk = JumioSDK(context: Context).apply { token = \"YOUR_SDK_TOKEN\" datacenter = JumioDataCenter.YOUR_DATACENTER } JumioDataCenter values: US , EU , SG Controller Handling Start the SDK by passing context and an instance of your class that implements JumioControllerInterface . You will receive a JumioController object in return: val jumioController: JumioController = sdk.start(context, jumioControllerInterface) When the jumioController is initialized, the following callback will be triggered: onInitialized(credentials: List<JumioCredentialInfo>, consentItems: List<JumioConsentItems>?) Consent Handling To support compliance with various data protection laws, if a user\u2019s consent is required the parameter consentItems will provide a list of JumioConsentItems . Each consent item contains a text, a consent type and an URL that will redirect the user to Jumio\u2019s consent details. Each JumioConsentItem also provides a method spannedTextWithLinkColor(color: Int) that will return a spanned string containing the consent text and the link holder. If no color is specified, the link portion of the spanned string will only be underlined. If no consent is required, the parameter consentItems will be null . Each consent item can be one of two types: * JumioConsentType.ACTIVE * JumioConsentType.PASSIVE For ACTIVE types, the user needs to accept the consent items explicitly, e.g. by enabling a UI switch or checking a checkbox for each consent item. For PASSIVE types, it is enough to present the consent text and URL to the user. The user implicitly accepts the passive consent items by continuing with the journey. For details please check out consent handling (1) (2) and consent adapter in our sample app. The user can open and continue to the provided consent link if they choose to do so. If the user consents to Jumio's policy, jumioController.userConsented(consentItem: JumioConsentItem, userConsent: Boolean) is required to be called internally before any credential can be initialized and the user journey can continue. If no consent is required, the list of JumioConsentItems will be null . If the user does not consent or if jumioController.userConsented(consentItem: JumioConsentItem, userConsent: Boolean) is not called for all the items inside the consentItems list, the user will not be able to continue the user journey. \u26a0\ufe0f Note: Please be aware that in cases where the list of consentItems is not null , the user must consent to Jumio's processing of personal information, including biometric data, and be provided a link to Jumio's Privacy Notice. Do not accept automatically without showing the user any terms. Credential Handling Obtain an instance of JumioCredential which will contain all necessary information about the verification process by calling start on the JumioController . For ID verification you will receive a JumioIDCredential , for Identity Verification a JumioFaceCredential , and so on. Call isConfigured to check if the credential is already pre-configured. If so, it can be started right away. val currentCredentialInfo = ... val currentCredential = jumioController.start(currentCredentialInfo) if (currentCredential?.isConfigured == true) { // credential can be started } If the credential is not configured yet, it needs some more configuration before scan parts can be initialized. Details on how to configure each credential and retrieve the first scan part can be found below. JumioCredentialCategory values = ID , FACE , DOCUMENT , DATA Jumio ID Credential In case of JumioIDCredential , you can retrieve all available countries from supportedCountries . After selecting a specific country from that list, you can query available documents for that country by either calling getPhysicalDocumentsForCountry or getDigitalDocumentsForCountry . To configure the JumioIDCredential , pass your desired document as well as the country to setConfiguration() . Retrieve the supported countries: idCredential = ... // Credential received via jumioController.start val countries: List<String> = idCredential.countries val country = countries.first { ... } // Select your desired country Query available physical documents (e.g. passports or driving licenses): val jumioDocuments = idCredential.getPhysicalDocumentsForCountry(country) val document = jumioDocuments.first { it.type == JumioDocumentType.PASSPORT } Query available digital documents (\"Digital Identities\"): val jumioDocuments = idCredential.getDigitalDocumentsForCountry(country) val document = jumioDocuments.first() Set a valid country / document configuration: idCredential.setConfiguration(country, document) JumioPhysicalDocument represents a single JumioDocumentType and JumioDocumentVariant combination JumioDocumentType values: PASSPORT , VISA , DRIVING_LICENSE , ID_CARD JumioDocumentVariant values: PAPER , PLASTIC JumioDigitalDocument represents a digital document (\"Digital Identity\") Once the credential is configured, it is ready to initialize it's first scan part and start the verification process: val credentialPart = idCredential.credentialParts.first() idCredential.initScanPart(credentialPart, yourScanPartInterface) Jumio Face Credential In case of JumioFaceCredential , depending of the configuration the SDK uses the Certified Liveness technology from iProov to determine liveness or the manual face detection. The mode can be detected by checking the JumioScanMode of the JumioScanPart . Make sure to also implement FACE_MANUAL as a fallback, in case FACE_IPROOV is not available. Retrieve the credential part of the credential to start the scanning process by calling: val credentialPart = currentCredential?.credentialParts?.first() val scanPart = currentCredential?.initScanPart(credentialPart, yourScanPartInterface) or use the convenience method val scanPart = currentCredential?.initScanPart(yourScanPartInterface) Jumio Document Credential In case of JumioDocumentCredential , there is the option to either acquire the image using the camera or selecting a PDF file from the device. Call setConfiguration with a JumioAcquireMode to select the preferred mode as described in the code documentation. JumioAcquireMode values: CAMERA , FILE val acquireModes: List<JumioAcquireMode> = (credential as JumioDocumentCredential).availableAcquireModes (currentCredential as JumioDocumentCredential).setConfiguration(acquireModes[0]) Retrieve the credential part of the credential to start the scanning process by calling: val credentialPart = currentCredential?.credentialParts?.first() val scanPart = currentCredential?.initScanPart(credentialPart, yourScanPartInterface) or use the convenience method val scanPart = currentCredential?.initScanPart(yourScanPartInterface) If JumioAcquireMode FILE is used, the JumioFileAttacher needs to be utilized to add a File or FileDescriptor for the selected JumioScanPart . val fileAttacher = JumioFileAttacher() fileAttacher.attach(scanPart) val file = File(\"/path/to/your/file.pdf\") fileAttacher.setFile(file) Jumio Data Credential JumioDataCredential is used for the device fingerprinting. There are some optional configurations you can do to enhance it's behavior. Add the following Android permissions to your AndroidManifest.xml , if not already added: <manifest> <!--Get user's GPS Location.--> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\" /> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\" /> <!--Get User's Wifi name and Status.--> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\" /> <!--Get User's Network information and State.--> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\" /> <!--Get Phone and Network information (MNC, MCC, IMEI, Phone Number, Phone Type (GSM/CDMA), SIM Number, etc).--> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE\" /> <!--Get user's Biometric authentication settings (Face or Fingerprint authentication).--> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.USE_BIOMETRIC\" /> <!--Get user's Biometric authentication settings (Face or Fingerprint authentication).--> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.USE_FINGERPRINT\" /> <!--Write data into device to check re-installation behavior.--> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" /> <!--Get External storage status, total size, free size, etc.--> <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\" /> <!--Get GSFID (Google Services Id) for accurate identification for unique users.--> <uses-permission android:name=\"com.google.android.providers.gsf.permission.READ_GSERVICES\" /> </manifest> \u2139\ufe0f Note: The reason for the requirement of the given permission is added as inline comment. Some of them are dangerous permissions, and you have to ask for the permission from the user. More information about permissions can be found in the official Android documentation The above permissions imply to add some features to your manifest file: <uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.location\" android:required=\"false\"/> <uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.telephony\" android:required=\"false\"/> <uses-feature android:name=\"android.hardware.wifi\" android:required=\"false\"/> If you use proguard for obfuscation, you have to add some rules to your proguard-rules.pro configuration file: -keep com.google.android.gms.* -keep com.google.android.gms.tasks.* -keep com.google.android.gms.ads.identifier.AdvertisingIdClient ScanPart Handling The following sequence diagram outlines an overview of ScanPart handling details: Start the scanning process by initializing the JumioScanPart . A list of mandatory JumioCredentialPart s is retrievable over currentCredential?.credentialParts as soon as the credential is configured. Possible values are: currentScanPart = currentCredential?.initScanPart(credentialPart, yourJumioScanPartInterface) JumioCredentialPart values: FRONT , BACK , MULTIPART , FACE , DOCUMENT , NFC , DEVICE_RISK MULTIPART handles the scanning of multiple sides in one seamless capture experience. When a MULTIPART scan part is started, an additional NEXT_PART step is sent after IMAGE_TAKEN . This signals that another side of the document should be scanned now. The step returns the JumioCredentialPart that should be scanned next. We suggest to actively guide the user to move to the next part, e.g. by showing an animation and by disabling the extraction during the animation. Please also check the new NEXT_PART scan step for this JumioCredentialPart Start the execution of the acquired JumioScanPart by calling currentScanPart?.start() . When the scanning is done, the parameter JumioScanStep.CAN_FINISH will be received and the scan part can be finished by calling currentScanPart?.finish() . Check if the credential is complete by calling currentCredential?.isComplete and finish the current credential by calling currentCredential?.finish() . Continue that procedure until all needed credentials (e.g. ID , FACE , DOCUMENT ) are finished. Check if all credentials are finished with jumioController.isComplete , then call jumioController?.finish() to finish the user journey. The callback onFinished() will be received after the controller has finished: override fun onFinished(result: JumioResult) { log(\"onFinished\") sdkResult.value = result } Scan steps During the scanning process onScanStep() will be called as soon as the JumioScanPart needs additional input to continue the scanning journey. The provided JumioScanStep indicates what needs to be done next. JumioScanStep covers lifecycle events which require action from the customer to continue the process. JumioScanStep values: PREPARE , STARTED , ATTACH_ACTIVITY , ATTACH_FILE , SCAN_VIEW , NEXT_PART , IMAGE_TAKEN , PROCESSING , CONFIRMATION_VIEW , REJECT_VIEW , RETRY , CAN_FINISH , ADDON_SCAN_PART , DIGITAL_IDENTITY_VIEW , THIRD_PARTY_VERIFICATION PREPARE is only sent if a scan part requires upfront preparation and the customer should be notified (e.g. by displaying a loading screen): JumioScanStep.PREPARE -> { showLoadingView() } STARTED is always sent when a scan part is started. If a loading spinner was triggered before, it can now be dismissed: JumioScanStep.STARTED -> { hideLoadingView() } ATTACH_ACTIVITY indicates that an Activity Context is needed. Please see JumioActivityAttacher for more information. JumioScanStep.ATTACH_ACTIVITY -> { currentScanPart?.let { JumioActivityAttacher(this).attach(it) } } ATTACH_FILE is called when a File through the JumioFileAttacher can be added to the JumioScanPart . JumioScanStep.ATTACH_FILE -> { currentScanPart?.let { val jumioFileAttacher = JumioFileAttacher() jumioFileAttacher.attach(it) // Choose how the file should be attached // jumioFileAttacher.setFileDescriptor(<your file descriptor>) // jumioFileAttacher.setFile(<your file>) } } SCAN_VIEW points out that a JumioScanView needs to be attached to the JumioScanPart . The JumioScanView is a custom view that can be placed in your layout. During runtime it just needs to be attached to the JumioScanPart . JumioScanStep.SCAN_VIEW -> { currentScanPart?.let { jumioScanView.attach(it) } } IMAGE_TAKEN is triggered as soon as the image is taken and has been uploaded to the Jumio server. The camera preview is stopped during that step if no additional part needs to be scanned. Otherwise NEXT_PART will be triggered with additional information on which part has to be scanned next. When background processing is executed, JumioScanStep.PROCESSING is triggered. If images for confirmation or rejection need to be displayed then JumioScanStep.CONFIRMATION_VIEW or JumioScanStep.REJECT_VIEW is triggered. Simply attach the JumioConfirmationHandler or JumioRejectHandler once the steps are triggered and render the available JumioCredentialParts in JumioConfirmationView or JumioRejectView objects: JumioScanStep.CONFIRMATION_VIEW -> { val confirmationHandler = ConfirmationHandler() confirmationHandler.attach(scanPart) confirmationHandler.parts.forEach { val confirmationView = JumioConfirmationView(context) confirmationHandler.renderPart(it, confirmationView) ... } } JumioScanStep.REJECT_VIEW -> { val rejectHandler = RejectHandler() rejectHandler.attach(scanPart) rejectHandler.parts.forEach { val rejectView = JumioRejectView(context) rejectHandler.renderPart(it, rejectView) ... } } The scan part can be confirmed by calling confirmationView.confirm() or retaken by calling confirmationView.retake() or rejectView.retake() . The retry scan step returns a data object of type JumioRetryReason . On RETRY , a retry should be triggered on the scan part. JumioScanStep.RETRY -> { val reason = data as? JumioRetryReason ?: return val retryCode = reason.code val retryMessage = reason.message ... currentScanPart?.retry(reason) } For possible retry codes please checkout JumioRetryReasonGeneric , JumioRetryReasonDocumentVerification , JumioRetryReasonNfc , JumioRetryReasonIproov and JumioRetryReasonDigitalIdentity . DIGITAL_IDENTITY_VIEW points out that the current JumioScanPart needs to be attached to a JumioDigitalIdentityView . The JumioDigitalIdentityView is a custom view that can be placed in your layout. JumioScanStep.DIGITAL_IDENTITY_VIEW -> { currentScanPart?.let { jumioDigitalIdentityView.attach(it) } } THIRD_PARTY_VERIFICATION is triggered in case the current JumioScanPart will switch to a third party's application to continue the verification process (e.g. for Digital Identity verification). As this might take some time, showing a loading indicator is recommended. JumioScanStep.THIRD_PARTY_VERIFICATION -> { showLoadingView() } As soon as the scan part has been confirmed and all processing has been completed CAN_FINISH is triggered. scanPart.finish() can now be called. During the finish routine the SDK checks if there is an add-on functionality for this part available, e.g. possible NFC scanning after an MRZ scan part. In this case ADDON_SCAN_PART will be called When an add-on to the current scan part is available, JumioScanStep.ADDON_SCAN_PART is sent. The add-on scan part can be retrieved using the method addonScanPart = currentCredential?.getAddonPart() . Scan Updates Apart from the scan steps, there are also scan updates distributed the scanPart method onUpdate() . They cover additional scan information that is relevant and might need to be displayed during scanning. The parameters are JumioScanUpdate and an optional value data of type Any that can contain additional information for each scan update as described. JumioScanUpdate values: LEGAL_HINT , CAMERA_AVAILABLE , FALLBACK , NFC_EXTRACTION_STARTED , NFC_EXTRACTION_PROGRESS , NFC_EXTRACTION_FINISHED , CENTER_ID , HOLD_STRAIGHT , MOVE_CLOSER , TOO_CLOSE , HOLD_STILL , MOVE_FACE_CLOSER , FACE_TOO_CLOSE For FALLBACK , there are 2 possible JumioFallbackReason 's sent in the optional data value to indicate the reason of the fallback. Result and Error Handling Instead of using the standard method onActivityResult() , implement the following methods within your jumioControllerInterface for successful scans and error notifications: The method onFinished(result: JumioResult) has to be implemented to handle data after a successful scan, which will return JumioResult . override fun onFinished(result: JumioResult) { val data = result // handle success case finish() } The method onError(error: JumioError) has to be implemented to handle data after an unsuccessful scan, which will return JumioError . Check the parameter error.isRetryable to see if the failed scan attempt can be retried. override fun onError(error: JumioError) { if (error.isRetryable) { // retry scan attempt } else { // handle error case } log(String.format(\"onError: %s, %s, %s\", error.code, error.message, if (error.isRetryable) \"true\" else \"false\")) } If an error is retryable, jumioController.retry() should be called to execute a retry. Instant Feedback The use of Instant Feedback provides immediate end user feedback by performing a usability check on any image the user took and prompting them to provide a new image immediately if this image is not usable, for example because it is too blurry. Please refer to the JumioRejectReason table for a list of all reject possibilities. Customization The Jumio SDK provides various options to customize its UI. If you are using Default UI you can change each screen to fulfil your needs. In case you decide to implement the verification workflow on your own (see Custom UI ) you also have the possibility to influence the look and feel of some views provided by the SDK, e.g. JumioScanView . Customization Tool Jumio Surface is a web tool that offers the possibility to apply and visualize all available customization options for the Jumio SDK, as well as an export feature that generates all data needed to import the desired changes straight into your codebase. Default UI customization The surface tool utilizes each screen of Jumio's Default UI to visualize all items and colors that can be customized. If you are planning to use the Default UI implementation, you can specify the Theme.Jumio as a parent style in your application and override according attributes within this theme to match your application's look and feel. After customizing the SDK via the surface tool, you can click the Android-Xml button in the Output menu on the bottom right to copy the code from the theme AppThemeCustomJumio to your Android app's styles.xml file. Apply your custom theme that you defined before by replacing Theme.Jumio in the AndroidManifest.xml: <activity android:name=\"com.jumio.defaultui.JumioAcitivty\" android:theme=\"@style/AppThemeCustomJumio\"> ... </activity> Dark Mode Theme.Jumio attributes can also be customized for dark mode. If you haven't done so already, create a values-night folder in your resources directory and add a new styles.xml file. Adapt your custom Jumio theme for dark mode. The SDK will switch automatically to match the system settings of the user device. Custom UI customization If you implement your own UI, you can still customize how some views provided by the SDK look. In particular this means you can customize Jumio's scan overlay , NFC scanning and iProov Face liveness views at the moment. By following the steps explained in Default UI customization you can see potential attributes to override in the generated XML file. Security All SDK related traffic is sent over HTTPS using TLS and public key pinning. Additionally, the information itself within the transmission is also encrypted utilizing Application Layer Encryption (ALE). ALE is a Jumio custom-designed security protocol that utilizes RSA-OAEP and AES-256 to ensure that the data cannot be read or manipulated even if the traffic was captured.

This will enable you to make use of DID verification within the SDK. Over the course of DID verification the SDK will launch an according third party application representing your Digital Identity. Communication between both applications (your integrating application and the Digital Identity application) is done via a so-called \"deep link\". For more information on deep link handling on Android please check out their official guide .","title":"Digital Identity (DID)"},{"location":"integration_guide/#deep-link-setup","text":"To enable your app specific deep link, our support team has to setup an according scheme of your choice for you. This scheme will be used by the SDK to identify your application while returning from the DID provider's application. For the scheme basically any string can be used, however it is recommended that it is unique to your application in some way. A suggestion would be your company name. Following snippet shows how the deep link needs to be setup in your application's AndroidManifest.xml file: <activity android:name=\"com.jumio.app.HostingActivity\" android:exported=\"true\" android:launchMode=\"singleTask\" android:theme=\"@style/Theme.Jumio\"> <intent-filter> <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.VIEW\" /> <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.DEFAULT\" /> <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.BROWSABLE\" /> <data android:scheme=\"<your-app-scheme>\" /> </intent-filter> </activity> Please note that the properties android:exported=\"true\" and android:launchMode=\"singleTask\" need to be specified as well. The first parameter basically tells the Android system that your Activity can be found by the system and other applications. By specifying launchMode=\"singleTask\" any already running task for this Activity will be resumed (instead of creating a new instance). Both are requirements so that the SDK can handle the according deep link correctly. In case you are using Jumio's Default UI in your app (see section Default UI ) you also need to specify tools:replace=\"android:exported\" to JumioActivity 's <activity> tag like so: <activity android:name=\"com.jumio.defaultui.JumioActivity\" android:exported=\"true\" android:launchMode=\"singleTask\" tools:replace=\"android:exported\"> <intent-filter> ... </intent-filter> </activity> As deep link handling happens on Activity level, the according data needs to be forwarded to the SDK via Activity.onNewIntent() . The following code snippet shows how this can be achieved. If you're using Jumio's Default UI you can ignore this step . override fun onNewIntent(intent: Intent) { super.onNewIntent(intent) intent.data?.let { deepLink -> val activeScanPart = scanPart ?: return JumioDeepLinkHandler.consumeForScanPart(deepLink, activeScanPart) } }","title":"Deep link setup"},{"location":"integration_guide/#initialization","text":"","title":"Initialization"},{"location":"integration_guide/#requesting-a-token-via-oauth2","text":"Your OAuth2 credentials are constructed using your API token as the Client ID and your API secret as the Client secret.

Issues with okhttp3 Dependency Using iProov iProov indirectly depends on okhttp 3.8.1. As of now, issues related to okhttp have been due to the use of okhttp 4.x. This can be solved by downgrading the dependency that provides 4.x, by excluding the okhttp package from that dependency, or by a combination of both of these. (Please note that a 3.x version is not necessarily older than 4.x one.) Please also refer to iProov FAQ for further information. Jetifier Issues Due to a bug in the Jetifier, the Bouncycastle library needs to be added to the Jetifiers ignorelist in the gradle.properties android.jetifier.blacklist=bcprov-jdk15on Please note that the naming of this will change with the Android Gradle Plugin 4 release and will become android.jetifier.ignorelist Custom UI On using iProov in CustomUI, in case NetverifySDKController$retry function is called for an error EXX0000, the SDK can fail with the following exception: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Failed resolution of: Lcom/jumio/zoom/custom/ZoomCustomScanPresenter . This issue was fixed in SDK version 3.9.0. As a workaround it is possible to only add implementation \"com.jumio.android:zoom:3.8.0@aar\" to the build.gradle dependencies. SDK Version 3.7.x Kotlin Integration Since the Jumio SDK is partly written in Kotlin, it is necessary to add the Kotlin standard library dependency to your project, even if the project itself if written in Java. Miscellaneous Static Interface Methods Are only Supported with Android N Error message \"Static interface methods are only supported with Android N\" will be displayed when Java 8 compatibility is not enabled. In this case, please make sure to enable compatibility in your build.gradle file: android { ... compileOptions { sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8 targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8 } } SDK Crashes Trying to Display Animations (Android Version 5 and Lower) Running the SDK on API Level 21/Android Version 5 (\"Lollipop\") or lower, the application might crash when trying to display Jumio animations.

Our SDK releases are published publicly as indicated in our documentation as well as to package managers. Documentation and sample implementations are available as source code on GitHub ( Android and iOS ). We are consistently updating the Jumio SDKs in order to provide the best possible experience for you. Upgrading to the latest SDK version will not only ensure you benefit from various performance enhancements and bug fixes, but will also allow you to take advantage of new capabilities. All releases undergo comprehensive testing by our teams before being deployed. If you are using a Mobile SDK, please ensure your apps have been released and your end-users have updated before the End-of-Support date. Jumio does not provide support after the End-of-Support date. Customers should review the Jumio Terms and Conditions for requirements related to the implementation of updates. Versioning Jumio SDK release versions are in the form of X.Y.Z: * X major version - very rarely updated * Y minor version - normally updated once in a quarter * Z patch version - updated on demand Major versions of Jumio\u2019s SDKs are released rarely, and only in case of substantial changes to support new features and patterns. Breaking changes can happen in Major and Minor versions. Applications need to be updated in order for them to work with the newest SDK version. Breaking changes are highlighted in our Android and iOS implementation guides for each release. Jumio will only provide patches or additional updates on the latest version regardless if it\u2019s Major, Minor or Patch. SDK Version Lifecycle The life-cycle for SDK versions consists of these phases, which are outlined below: * Developer Preview (Phase 0) - During this phase, SDKs are not supported, must not be used in production environments, and are meant for early access and feedback purposes only. It is possible for future releases to introduce breaking changes. It can be alpha, beta, or release candidate. * General availability / Full support (Phase 1) - During this phase, SDKs are fully supported. Jumio will provide active support on this version and will provide required bug fixes or security fixes within new / upcoming versions (major, minor, patch). * End-of-Support (Phase 2) - Each SDK version reaches end of support 9 months after the release date. Issues that appear after the End-of-Support date will only be addressed in the upcoming SDK releases. Previously published releases will continue to be available via public package managers and the code will remain on GitHub. Use of an SDK that has reached End-of-Support is done at the business customers\u2019 discretion. We recommend upgrading to the latest version. * End-of-Life (Phase 3) - By default, our SDK will reach the end of life 24 months after the release date. The SDK may continue to work but Jumio will no longer provide support or updates. Customers will be notified at least 3 months prior to the end of life of a product should it be less than 24 months.
